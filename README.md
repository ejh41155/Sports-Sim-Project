# Sports-Sim-Project

This project is a sports player managenment system written in C++. It utilizes a custom player class, where differet players have values such as position, age, and overall rating. 
The players when created are stored in a hashmap for later use. The hashmap has different features such as adding, searching for and displaying player class objects. 
There is a compare player feature where two players can be compared by there different values.


The player object have the following modifiable values:

Name
Sport
Position
Age
Overall Rating
Years of Experience
Salary

All of these values can be compared using the compare player function.

How to Run: (An example is already set up in Main)

Run the program from an IDe or Command Line
Create the players using CreatePlayer Function, then insert them into the hashmap, and the run comparison function


This project highlights:

Understanding of C++ classes & objects

Implementation of a hash-based data structure

Simple algorithmic comparison logic

Clean code organization across multiple files
